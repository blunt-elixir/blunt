* Ideas [2/4]
** TODO add result_mapper function option to command and query macros
This will require a way to store a Function ref in an Ecto type. ~:any~ would probably be fine. Just have to manually validate it in Message.Options.

** DONE +put message_opts property in DispatchContext+

** STRT support {m,f,a} for default field values
** DONE allow for putting values into context and returning them back with the context.
